The neural network model with three hidden layers (6, 35, 60 neurons) is designed to classify data based on input features. 
The architecture allows the model to capture complex patterns and relationships through multiple layers of abstraction. 
The network's performance is evaluated based on its accuracy, and the training process involves adjusting weights to minimize the error between predictions and actual values.
